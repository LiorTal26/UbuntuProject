# Lior Tal Final project Linux
This project provides a set of scripts for monitoring, backup, and cleanup tasks in a Ubuntu environment. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the scripts.

## Requirements
- Linux-based system.
- `cron` service installed for scheduling tasks.
- Root permissions to install and configure the scripts.

## Installation

1. **Put all scripts in the same directory:**
   - Place the following scripts in the same directory as `bootstrap.sh`:
     - `menu.sh`
     - `monitor.sh`
     - `backup.sh`
     - `cleanup.sh`

2. **Run the `bootstrap.sh` script:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
   - Run the installation script:
     `bash`
     sudo ./bootstrap.sh
     ```
   - This will copy all scripts to `/usr/local/bin`, make them executable,
     and add cron jobs for periodic tasks without overwriting existing cron jobs.

3. **Update your network interface:**
   - Open the `monitor.sh` script in a text editor.
   - Update the value of `NET_INTERFACE` to match your system's network interface:
     ```bash
     NET_INTERFACE="your-network-interface-name <iface>"
     ```
   - You can find your interface name using:
     `ls /sys/class/net`


## Verify Cron Jobs
To verify that the cron jobs have been added:
1. Open your crontab file:
   `sudo crontab -e`
2. List all active cron jobs:
    ## copy the this code to you cron :
    The cron jobs should look like this:
    `Copy this code`
    0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitor.sh
    0 2 4,20 * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
    0 3 1 * * /usr/local/bin/cleanup.sh
3. check if crontab:
    crontab -l

## running the scripts:
1. Run the Scripts Manually:
    - Run the `-menu.sh` script:
    ` sudo /usr/local/bin/menu.sh`

    - Run Monitor script:
     `sudo /usr/local/bin/monitor.sh`

    - Run backup script:
      `sudo /usr/local/bin/backup.sh `

    - Run cleanup script:
      `sudo /usr/local/bin/cleanup.sh`
